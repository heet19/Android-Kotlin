    <string name="text_cardThree">Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that securely records transactions across multiple computers. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a continuous chain. This structure makes it extremely difficult to alter any data once it is recorded, ensuring transparency and security.

The most well-known application of blockchain is cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, where blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. However, blockchain has applications far beyond digital currencies. It is also used in supply chain management, voting systems, smart contracts, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Key features of blockchain technology include immutability, which ensures that once data is recorded, it cannot be changed without altering the entire chain, and transparency, as all participants in the network can view the transaction history. It also operates on a consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), to validate transactions.

Blockchain’s ability to create secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant systems is transforming various industries, from finance to healthcare. For developers, understanding blockchain opens up opportunities to build decentralized applications (dApps) and contribute to the future of digital systems.</string>

    <string name="text_cardSix">AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are fields of computer science focused on creating systems that can learn from data and make decisions or predictions without explicit programming.

**AI** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that can perform tasks like understanding natural language, visual perception, and decision-making. It includes various subfields such as **natural language processing (NLP)**, **robotics**, and **computer vision**.

**Machine Learning (ML)**, a subset of AI, involves teaching computers to learn patterns from data and improve over time through experience. ML algorithms are divided into three main types:
- **Supervised Learning**, where the model is trained on labeled data to predict outcomes.
- **Unsupervised Learning**, where the model identifies patterns in data without labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning**, where the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

**Deep Learning**, a specialized area within ML, uses neural networks with many layers to process vast amounts of data, enabling tasks such as image recognition, speech synthesis, and autonomous driving.
